# Holistic Bioinformatic Approaches used in Microbiome Research
 A step-by-step open access conference showcasing state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipelines within microbiome research
 
The Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BVCN) is committed to reducing entry barriers into bioinformatics for researchers. For the first time in June 2021, this online conference will bring together ECRs from across the globe who are equally committed to reducing such entry barriers, and who would like to exchange and share their research and bioinformatics experiences in a step-by-step format with a global and interdisciplinary audience.

**Self-nominations are accepted and encouraged!! Do not convince yourself not to apply because one or more of these categories are not a perfect fit!**

## Speaker details

#### Speaker attributes
- Early career researcher (graduate students, postdoc, or pre-tenure faculty)
- Have a published record of bioinformatic centric research (preprints by June 2021 accepted) 
- Committed to open science, data, and protocols 
- Flexible schedule to work with organizing committee to make presentations accessible to all

#### Speaker commitments

* Speakers will create an hour long presentation that details the FULL bioinformatic methods that happen in a body of research (1 or more preprints/publications) 
  * We encourge the "full methods" to include hiccups, deadends, false positives, and issues that made you want to scream 
* Presentations will be recorded prior to the week of the conference to allow for closed captioning (recording dates flexible)
* Speakers will participate in a live (unrecorded) Q&A on 10 June 2021
* Speakers will work with the organizing committee to translate the methods in their presentation into an open format and/or workflow to be hosted on suitable platform
* All speakers must adhere to the established BVCN Code of Conduct (https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/code-of-conduct/) and modifications as necessary during conference planning.

#### Speaker benefits

* Honorarium
* Assistance/guidance in converting static workflows into reproducible, open-access workflows
* An international audience for your research, expertise, and brilliance!

## Conference Diversity Goals

Diversity of nominees, country of residence, and research topics will considered in the final decision for speakers.

All collected demographic information is optional and sharing will be minimized to protect your privacy. Initially, only a single member will have access to the data, which will be kept private. Demographics will be shared amongst the other organizing members only when necessary to make an informed decision.

All decisions regarding speakers and attendees will be to maximize the diversity of the conference program.

## Selection Process

Nominees with be assessed using a rubric format to identify individuals who would be most appropriate for a speaker role. The rubric will assess nominees for:

* suggested presentation topics
* contribution/commitment to open science
* commitment to DEI initiatives
* translational value of work between microbiology fields
* breadth of work
* options for community engagement
* diversity of speakers

Nominees will be short listed. At which point, nominees will be asked to provide a brief CV and a 2-3 minute video pitching their talk/research. These videos will be used as a future advertisement for the conference.
