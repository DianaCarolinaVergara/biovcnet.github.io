# Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network Code of Conduct

This document is adapted from guidelines written for The Carpentries Handbook. Additional language was added under a CC BY 3.0 license.

## Summary
The Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BVCN) is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by this Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:
* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please contact a BVCN instructor or BVCN Project Lead Dr. Tully (tully.bj@gmail.com) directly, who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

## Code of Conduct
### Part 1. Introduction
BVCN is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in BVCN activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions related to the BVCN including, but not limited to, digital meetings, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Instructors are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct will be enforced by the BVCN Coordinating Committee and who can be contacted via email and Slack. All reports will be kept confidential.

### Part 2. BVCN Code of Conduct
BVCN is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, percieved status of supporting institution, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in BVCN activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by BVCN, but not limited to, digital meetings, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Instructors are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which BVCN resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

### Part 2.1 Expected behaviour
All participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all BVCN events and platforms:
* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour
Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants related to BVCN include:
* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* the display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* insults or put downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* excessive swearing
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* publication of private communication without consent
* publication or use of data without consent

### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour
Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to all events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform, or initiate an investigation of the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions, including removal from all future events or current platforms.

### Part 2.4 Project-based Learning Modules
Several avenues for learning offered by BVCN include project-based modules. These modules may include significant scientific contributions from the project-lead (identified as the individual(s) who outlined the scope of the project), other instructors, and participating learners. It is expected that all individuals who provided significant contribution to the project, as outlined here, will be offered authorship on any subsequent publications. Contributions that collectively meet the threshold of authorship as outlined by International Committee of Medical Journal Editors include, (1) substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND (2) drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND (3) final approval of the version to be published; AND (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. Additionally, the following are examples that alone do not meet the authorship threshold including, acquisition of funding; general supervision of a research group or general administrative support; and writing assistance, technical editing, language editing, and proofreading. 

BVCN will not tolerate individuals exploiting the scientific endeavors of others, including at the preliminary planning phase. Authorship agreements are made between the individuals involved in the project (i.e., project progenitor(s), instructors, learners, etc.) and we encourage project-based modules to be clear about authorship and authorship order early and often. Authorships and credit disputes can be directed to the BVCN Coordinating Committee. The Project Lead and Coordinating Committee will only address issues of credit/authorship in cases where the Code of Conduct has been violated; disagreements about authorship order will be mediated through the BVCN members.
