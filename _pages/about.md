Welcome to the website for the Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BioVCN). Many research laboratories are currently shutting down due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. This leaves academics at all levels in a difficult position - where research in the lab [may not resume for many months](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR2vwiQNBs_lisviJG3d2VAl-etCEuVsMCGEV09YEilvrwTL1Zwv0Qd34Dg){:target="_blank}. We are a group of bioinformaticians and computational biologists committed to helping wet-lab biologists pick up some computational skills/begin computational projects during this global crisis. 

Please see [here](https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/get-involved/) if you'd like to be involved by either helping or participating or both!
